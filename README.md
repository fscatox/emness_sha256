# SHA-256 core linux driver on a ZYNQ APSoC 

Open access lab experience as an introduction to the development of
Linux/FreeRTOS device drivers for hardware accelerators.

The idea comes from the [EMNESS](https://emness.eu) initiative, with the goal
of structuring innovative academic curricula on reliability and hardware
security.
